| **IMPORTANT** |
| With the launch of the Amazon Signage Stick, Amazon has been removing support for digital signage on FireSticks. As such, OptiSigns will be ending its support for Amazon Firesticks in the near future**.** We recommend our OptiStick device, or the Amazon Signage Stick. Also in 2024, [Amazon released an update to FireOS](link) disallowing apps to be autostarted on device boot up. Amazon has also released a [Digital Signage Stick](link) to replace the FireStick as a digital signage option. [Amazon is also pushing advertising services,](link) so device playback may be randomly interrupted. For these reasons, we no longer recommend FireStick as a digital signage player. We recommend an Amazon Signage Stick, Windows or Linux device, Chromecast, or our [Android Player Stick](https://shop.optisigns.com/products/optisigns-android-stick-player-2). |

**VegaOS (2025-Present):**

OptiSigns runs on new VegaOS FireStick models, but with some restrictions. The app must be manually opened upon startup (no auto-start), and the app will go to sleep unless there is some sort of video playing every few minutes. For this reason, we recommend creating playlists with at least one video in it interspersed with images if you're wanting to use OptiSigns on a VegaOS FireStick.

**FireOS 8 (2023-2025) Model autostart:**

If you already have a newer model and still want to try to use it, and you can handle ADB via USB commands, [please follow this guide to enable](how-to-enable-auto-start-on-fireos-8-devices-like-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-gen-2-2023-model.md) ADB and autostart for your device.

**Networking: (This is the most common issue)**

- This test will resolve most of the networking issues:
 - Try mobile hotspot
 - Try different network (bring the device home or to another location)
- Other networking check:
 - Check internet connection - open side menu -> Troubleshooting. Check see if device is connected to our servers. Without connection device cannot receive files, content updates
 - [Reference of the Troubleshooting page of the OptiSigns app](how-to-access-the-troubleshooting-page-of-the-optisigns-player.md)
 - If you have firewalls, make sure our [servers are whitelisted.](whitelist-optisigns-ip-addresses-ports.md)

**Performance, Freezing:**

- FireStick and FireTVs are best with 3-4 zones without background music (or 2 zones with background music). If you more zones than that, you may experience instability.

**Check power cables & connections:**

- One of the most common causes of device stability is not using provided power adapters & cables. TV’s USB ports do not have sufficient power to stably run the device for extended periods of time

**HDMI & TV connection:**

- Try a different HDMI port on your TV
- Try to connect device directly to TV without HDMI extender
- Try a different TV, Monitor

**Device is on, but start playing black screen:**

- Check to make sure Device is not in [OnHold folder](https://app.optisigns.com/app/screenManagement?path=~2FOnhold%20Device&teamId=1) - sometimes you may not have enough licenses on your account when ordering devices so your device is in the OnHold folder.
 - Remove unused device or increase your subscription and move your device out of OnHold
- Check make sure there is playlist or other content assigned to your screen

**Remote Controller issues:**

- Ensure batteries are installed in remote controller, try fresh batteries.
- [Use your phone as FireTV/Stick remote](link)

**Factory Reset:**

Lastly, you can try [Factory Reset the device](how-to-factory-reset-your-fire-stick-device.md).
